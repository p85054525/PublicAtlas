# PublicAtlas

**PublicAtlas** is an open web platform where users can publish and comment on articles about **politics, economics, science**, and more.  
This project is being developed as part of my independent learning.

## Project Goals

- Build a fully functional multi-language web app (Spanish / English).
- Allow user registration, login, and authentication.
- Support article creation, editing, and commenting.
- Implement light/dark mode toggle.
- Learn and document every step of the process publicly.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – React-based framework for building fast, scalable web apps
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Node.js & npm** – JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project hosting
- **Vercel** – Deployment platform for Next.js apps

## Author

This project is being built from scratch by **me** as a personal project to learn full-stack web development.

## Getting Started (for developers)

To run this project locally:
npm install
npm run dev
Then visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Learning Goal

PublicAtlas is not just a technical project. It's an educational journey. I’m learning full-stack development from scratch and documenting everything — from core concepts to each design decision.
